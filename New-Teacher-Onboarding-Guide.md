Copilot uses AI trained on code—not mood or social patterns.

### Can Copilot help with desktop programs and Google Drive?
- **Yes, with code.**  
Copilot can generate Python/Java scripts to interact with Google Drive, but cannot directly sync files without you running code.

### Do I need advanced coding knowledge?
- **No.**  
Copilot is designed for all skill levels. Some familiarity helps, but isn’t required.
