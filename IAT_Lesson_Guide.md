## Overview

The Implicit Association Test (IAT), developed by Harvard researchers, measures unconscious biases and associations. This lesson helps students explore their own implicit attitudes and reflect on how these may affect perceptions and behavior.

---

## Objectives

- Understand the concept of implicit bias
- Experience the IAT and interpret results
- Reflect on the impact of unconscious attitudes
- Discuss other tools for self-awareness

## Teacher Instructions

### 1. Introduction (10 min)
- Briefly explain implicit bias and why it matters.
- Introduce the IAT as a research-based tool.

### 2. Accessing the IAT (5 min)
- Direct students to Project Implicit (https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/).
- Have students choose a test (e.g., Race, Gender, Age).

### 3. Taking the Test (15-20 min)
- Students complete the IAT individually online.
- Emphasize privacy: Results are for personal reflection.

### 4. Discussion & Debrief (20 min)
- Facilitate a supportive conversation:
  - What surprised you?
  - How do we develop unconscious attitudes?
  - How do these attitudes influence behavior?
  - What can we do to recognize and reduce bias?

### 5. Reflection Worksheet (Optional, see below)
- Provide a worksheet for students to write about their experience and insights.

## Alternative and Supplementary Assessments

Include one or more for broader self-awareness:
- Implicit Bias Self-Assessment: Written reflection prompts about stereotypes and personal experiences.
- Modern Racism Scale: Download questionnaire (https://www.midss.org/sites/default/files/modernracismscale.pdf) and distribute as a paper survey.
- Symbolic Racism 2000 Scale: Similar paper-based survey; available online.
- Other IATs: Use age, disability, sexuality, or weight bias versions from Project Implicit.
